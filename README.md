## Features

### Open Related Files QiuckPick list

Use the command `Open Related Files` or the default shortcut cmd+shift+r. This will show the Open Related Files QuickPick list. The list shows all extensions for related files - i.e. if you have opened `main.html` and there are `main.css` and `main.js` files in the same folder, the list will display `css` and `js`.

### Custom shortcuts

If you want to define your own custom shorctuts for specific extensions, use the command `extension.openRelatedFilesWithExtension`

Example:
```
{
  "key": "alt+cmd+c",
   "command": "openRelatedFiles.withExtension",
   "args": "css"
}
```

This shortcut will directly open a related file with `css` extension, if such file exists
